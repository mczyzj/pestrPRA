**Reason for performing the PRA:** *(e.g. interceptions, outbreak)*

**PRA area:** *specify the PRA area being assessed*

# (PART) Pest risk assessment {-}

(@) Taxonomy:

*e.g. Genus, species/ subspecies, Authority, Family, Order, Kingdom. Include information on strains and populations, etc. if relevant, and synonyms if appropriate.* [@eppo2018]

**Synonyms:**

**Common name:**

(@) Pest overview:

- **Summarize the life cycle** *(e.g. length of life cycle, location of different life stages, temperature thresholds, humidity - requirements) and other relevant information (damage should be described in Q 12). If a datasheet is available, this section should only include the basic information. If available place illustrations of the pest and the symptoms caused in Appendix 1.*

- **Host plants** *(for pests)/habitats (for invasive plants) (more detail should be provided in Q 7)*
- **Symptoms** 
- **Detection and identification** *(note if a diagnostic protocol is available). State if and how the pest can be trapped.*

(@) Is the pest a vector?

*Yes / No*

(@) Is the vector needed for pest entry or spread?

*Yes / No*

(@) Regulatory status of the pest:

*Is the pest already regulated by any NPPO, or recommended for regulation by any RPPO? (Assessors can check this by reference to EPPO PQR, RPPO and IPPC websites in addition to normal search mechanisms).*

(@) Distribution:

*Information on distribution may be retrieved from [PQR](http://www.eppo.int/DATABASES/pqr/pqr.htm), [CAPRA datasets](http://capra.eppo.org/), CABI maps, etc. Comments on distribution: (e.g. if known, please comment on the area of origin, how the pest has spread and on any evidence of increasing range / frequency of introductions)*

(@) Host plants/habitats and their distribution in the PRA area:

*If the host range is large, you may group plants (e.g. deciduous trees, or at the family level, e.g. Brassicaceae, Rosaceae), and/or focus on those occurring in the PRA area. When appropriate, the difference of susceptibility between hosts should be noted. If there are many habitats, focus on those occurring in the PRA area. Reference to [FAOSTAT](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC) and [EUROSTAT](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/) may help assess distribution of host plants.*

(@) Identification of the endangered area:

(@) Overall assessment of risk:

*Summarize the likelihood of entry, establishment, spread and possible impact without phytosanitary measure. An overall rating should be given in the summary part which is placed at the beginning of the Express PRA. Then consider whether phytosanitary measures are necessary. If the assessment shows that phytosanitary measures are not required for a country but there are indications that other EPPO countries are at higher risk, mention it.*
